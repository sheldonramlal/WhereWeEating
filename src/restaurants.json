Today I got the pistachio macaron and their lemon-passion fruit macaron.The pistachio macaron tastes just like plain cream. Tastes good, but very plain and not the usual quality I expect. The lemon passion fruit macaron, no lemon taste, and the teeniest, tiniest hint of passion fruit. Again, didn't taste bad, just dissapointing since I'm so used to their fantastic flavours. Perhaps their quality has deteriorated recently and I didn't realise till after I spent my $44",

She said that the advertised price was wrong and she gave me the correct change based on the “actual price” of the item (lol what?). I very quietly explained to her that I would have selected the item based on the advertised price and that the error should have been communicated before taking my money. She twisted her face, making a gesture of indifference and walked off. I stood there in mild disbelief when another young lady who observed the interaction came across and asked me how much I was shorted. The first young lady upon seeing the exchange that was now taking place walked back to the counter and expressed quite audibly “just give she she $5.” before taking $5. out of the tip jar, carelessly placing it on my box and walking off again. I can’t stress enough that if this person handled the situation differently I would have easily forfeited the difference and be on my way but I don’t think that reaction was warranted simply because I pointed out an inefficiency on her part. The second young lady very quietly apologized for the entire interaction and wished me a pleasant night which I return to her before leaving. Trust that I was still very annoyed by every aspect of this transaction and will certainly not subject myself to such poor customer service in the future.",

It took 15 minutes for a waitress to even glance in our direction, and I had to flag them down. Not off to a great start considering they were operating under reservations only and not exactly swamped, but okay. I and my friend placed our orders at 7:30 sharp. We walked out at 9 having received not a single thing. We got two drinks we ordered outside of the Buddha special, but food? Not even a grain of rice. We were lucky to share a single piece of calamari and one roll (of three ordered the rest of which never came) from another friend that arrived 15 minutes before us. We kept giving them the benefit of the doubt. Kept having to try and angle ourselves and fight to get our waitress to glance at us to ask her anything. But at 9PM our patience ran out. I skipped lunch in anticipation of a nice sushi dinner, and now it's 9:30 and I'm here writing this review while waiting on food from another restaurant because I'm starving and annoyed and just frankly fed up.Kaizen has the honor of earning my first ever 1-star review. This is the first time in my life I've walked out of a restaurant having decided never to return because of the service and not the food. Spare yourself the disappointment and just go to More Vino or Bottles and Bites. They have better food, similar prices, and infinitely superior service. Dietary restrictions: Ramadan friendly. If you're Muslim and fasting, you can safely visit Kaizen without breaking your fast.",
